# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM on Purdue-based Applications

As Purdue’s student body grows year after year, the university felt it necessary to build applications tied to certain campus services to provide students and faculty better experience. We have managed to find 5 Purdue published applications from the Apple App Store at the time of doing this project. They are:

* Purdue Guide 
* Purdue App
* Purdue Athletics
* Purdue RecWell
* Purdue Mobile Menus

Given that Purdue had to maintain all 5 applications, and reading the somewhat mixed reviews from the AppStore, we suspected that Purdue’s resources (both human and technical) may be spread too thin. Now it is entirely possible that Purdue may have made leaps and bounds in improving user experience with these applications, however, the reviews were rather outdated making it impossible for us to confirm this fact. As such, we decided to gauge user responses on these applications by using Google Forms to gather the most recent feedback on the performance of these applications. Our use of sentiment analysis to categorize reviews as either positive or negative in tone hopes to acknowledge the significant role that digital applications and services play in contemporary student life. We hope that our findings can provide Purdue affiliated developers with actionable insights on the various components of the app that should be kept in response to the positive reviews and ones that needed to be done away with or improved with regards to user reviews that are negative in tone.
