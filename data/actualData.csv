11/10/2023 8:13:46,Purdue Mobile Menus,Somewhat often,18-22,4,Good I like it but sometimes the dining courts don't have what's on the menu
11/17/2023 10:18:20,Purdue RecWell,Rarely,18-22,4,I do not use any of the Purdue affiliated apps that much.
11/17/2023 11:12:58,Purdue RecWell,Rarely,18-22,5,Very Slow and Laggy
11/17/2023 15:33:50,Purdue Guide,Rarely,30-50,2,Perfect
11/17/2023 15:34:14,Purdue RecWell,Somewhat often,30-50,3,The apps are alright 
11/17/2023 15:34:35,Purdue App,Rarely,22-30,2,It good
11/17/2023 15:34:52,Purdue App,Somewhat often,22-30,2,Amazing
11/17/2023 15:36:13,Purdue Mobile Menus,Very often,18-22,4,It’s usable to order Pete’s za. I wish there were more restaurants in there 
11/17/2023 15:36:34,Purdue Guide,Rarely,18-22,1,Its nice
11/17/2023 15:36:46,Purdue App,Somewhat often,22-30,5,Its amazing
11/17/2023 15:36:52,Purdue Mobile Menus,Rarely,18-22,3,I wish you could do more than one Pete’s za order at a time and the time tracking isn’t very accurate 
11/17/2023 15:36:57,Purdue Mobile Menus,Very often,18-22,3,Average
11/17/2023 15:37:04,Purdue Guide,Rarely,18-22,5,They definitely could have given us a tutorial on how to navigate the app when it was first installed and launched
11/17/2023 15:42:42,Purdue Athletics,Somewhat often,18-22,5,useful in helping me schedule rooms to reserve during covid but can be buggy sometimes
11/17/2023 15:45:59,Purdue Athletics,Rarely,30-50,4,Pretty positive!
11/17/2023 15:49:03,Purdue RecWell,,22-30,4,meh
11/17/2023 17:51:09,Purdue Mobile Menus,Very often,18-22,5,"It's helpful, and it gets its job done. However, the separation between residential and retail dining is inconvenient, and the menu lists are unintuitive. It works for me, but only because I have learned how to read it. The organization could be better."
11/17/2023 20:37:02,Purdue RecWell,Rarely,18-22,4,"Rarely need it, useful when I do use it"
11/18/2023 8:41:28,Purdue Athletics,Very often,22-30,4,It's okay
11/18/2023 8:42:40,Purdue Guide,Somewhat often,30-50,5,Really helpful to find out which events are hosted and where they are hosted in BGR
11/18/2023 8:43:32,Purdue RecWell,Somewhat often,30-50,4,Helpful in scheduling rooms to use for classes
11/18/2023 8:44:44,Purdue Mobile Menus,Very often,18-22,5,Very useful app in finding out what food is being served and calorie count for each food
11/18/2023 8:45:53,Purdue App,Rarely,18-22,5,It's an okay app but I rarely use it. It's been sitting on my phone for a year which reminds me that I should delete it because it's just taking up space
11/18/2023 8:48:11,Purdue Athletics,Rarely,18-22,5,It's seriously bugged. Apps won't open. Tried deleting it then reinstalling it but no avail. Terrible
11/18/2023 8:48:46,Purdue Athletics,Rarely,18-22,5,Can't login. My email password did not work. Requested new password. The temp password did not work to reset my access.   Not sure what the issue is here. Last app was better
11/18/2023 8:50:47,Purdue Guide,Rarely,18-22,5,The Purdue Guide app USED to tell you how to get to classes. You could also type in a hall or building name and it would take you there too.   This is basically only for BGR (which the old Purdue Guide did to) and it doesn’t even seem to be that good at it
11/18/2023 8:51:13,Purdue Guide,Rarely,18-22,5,This kinda stinks I think
11/18/2023 9:17:22,Purdue Mobile Menus,Somewhat often,18-22,5,"Crashes when signing in to view favorites, due to new duo-mobile two-factor identification. Would love a fix soon!"
11/18/2023 9:18:25,Purdue Mobile Menus,Somewhat often,22-30,5,"After the update, the app doesn’t show the work times of the Campus Dinning restaurants."
11/18/2023 9:18:54,Purdue Mobile Menus,Somewhat often,22-30,4,"Keeps crashing — completely unusable Whenever I try to open the app, it crashes within two seconds. I tried restarting my phone and reinstalling the app, but nothing seemed to work. I’m on an iPhone SE with iOS 13.1.3."
11/18/2023 9:19:39,Purdue Mobile Menus,Somewhat often,22-30,4,I enjoyed the app but with the new update they released nothing works now. I can’t see anything other than a blank white screen and if I try and sign in it won’t keep me signed in
11/18/2023 9:20:01,Purdue Mobile Menus,Very often,22-30,5,"I use it to find out what has or doesn’t have peanuts at Purdue, and it’s amazing."
11/18/2023 9:21:54,Purdue Mobile Menus,Somewhat often,18-22,4,"Shows you menus for dining courts, how far they are, and even shows what restaurants are nearby. Only takes a minute to fully set up."
11/18/2023 9:25:07,Purdue Mobile Menus,Rarely,18-22,5,"Functions like most other services on campus, gets the job done and but is mediocre at best and makes you wonder why you’re paying so much for a meal plan. Tells you the menus but is consistently wrong for one or two items each meal. If you temper your expectations it isn’t too frustrating, nice to know what you’re getting yourself into at a court which is already more than you can say about freshman advising"
11/18/2023 9:25:42,Purdue Mobile Menus,Very often,22-30,5,"Everything You Need Shows you menus for dining courts, how far they are, and even shows what restaurants are nearby. Only takes a minute to fully set up."
11/18/2023 9:28:39,Purdue RecWell,Somewhat often,18-22,5,Just provides links to their website. They also don’t know how to manage the app itself - still showed Summer hours a week after classes started.
11/18/2023 9:29:56,Purdue RecWell,Very often,18-22,5,The goat Absolutely cracked
11/18/2023 9:34:30,Purdue App,Very often,18-22,5,"This app has been very useful, but the laundry feature isn’t working anymore. When you select a laundry room it just shows up blank, and at the end of the list it has “laundry finished” over 100 times as options for laundry rooms, and they also show up blank. I don’t know what happened because a week or two ago it was working fine. Hope this gets fixed soon."
11/18/2023 9:36:45,Purdue App,Very often,18-22,5,okay so far
11/18/2023 9:37:22,Purdue Guide,Rarely,18-22,5,It's just been sitting on my phone collecting dust. Utterly useless
11/18/2023 9:37:52,Purdue Athletics,Somewhat often,18-22,5,Useful to have this on your phone during game day
11/21/2023 12:05:58,Purdue RecWell,Somewhat often,18-22,4,Good however bad UI
11/21/2023 12:06:21,Purdue Athletics,Somewhat often,22-30,3,Need better functionality
11/21/2023 12:06:45,Purdue Mobile Menus,Very often,18-22,5,Smooth Process but need better UI
11/21/2023 12:07:03,Purdue RecWell,Very often,18-22,5,Boring layout
11/21/2023 12:08:15,Purdue RecWell,Very often,18-22,4,Nice-want more involvement
11/21/2023 12:08:29,Purdue Athletics,Somewhat often,22-30,2,It's ok
11/21/2023 12:08:56,Purdue RecWell,Very often,18-22,3,"Improve it, but nice experience"
11/21/2023 12:11:27,Purdue RecWell,Somewhat often,18-22,3,Okay
11/21/2023 12:17:41,Purdue App,Somewhat often,18-22,2,Not thhe best
11/21/2023 14:21:04,Purdue Guide,Rarely,18-22,3,it's not better than maps and could have hours and stuff
11/21/2023 14:21:27,Purdue Mobile Menus,Somewhat often,18-22,2,i use it to see the menus website and it's ok
11/21/2023 14:21:46,Purdue Athletics,Rarely,18-22,3,I have it but I never need it
11/21/2023 14:22:04,Purdue Mobile Menus,Rarely,18-22,4,I wish it showed on the go hours it's not very helpful
